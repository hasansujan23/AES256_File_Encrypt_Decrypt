Virustotal Scans For My Files:

A word from @Th3Tr1ckst3r, these detections of trojans, and such are called false positives. This is a common problem that occurs
with pyinstaller because some hackers have used pyinstaller for bad things such as to compile viruses.

I released the source code of my files to prove they arent bad awhile ago, but I still believe people really need to stop using
pyinstaller for hacking other people. That way virustotal says my files are clean, and not this crap.
